# BeautyAPI

_English | [中文](README.zh.md)

### Overview

In order to reduce the difficulty for developers to integrate beauty, Shengwang provides a beauty scene-based API. The beauty scene API uses the **Shengwang RTC raw data interface** to encapsulate the beauty processing of different manufacturers, striving to provide the best beauty experience and minimize the beauty time as much as possible. You only need to call a few simple scene-based APIs to achieve smooth beautification effects.

This repository contains the following beauty scene APIs:

| Beauty    | Platform | Language    | Location                                                 | RTC SDK Version | Beauty SDK Version |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |-----------------| ------------------ |
